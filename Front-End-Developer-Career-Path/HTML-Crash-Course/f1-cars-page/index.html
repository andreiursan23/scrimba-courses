        <h1>Formula One cars: Engineering masterpieces</h1>
        <p>
          A <strong>Formula One car</strong> (also known as an F1 car) is a
          single-seat, open-cockpit, open-wheel formula racing car with
          substantial front and rear wings, and an engine positioned behind the
          driver, intended to be used in competition at Formula One racing
          events. Formula One cars are the
          <em>fastest cars around a race track</em>, owing to immense cornering
          speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic
          downforce.

          What makes these racing cars <em>unique</em>? We will go through all

            <h2>Chassis design</h2>
            <p>
              Modern-day Formula One cars are constructed from composites of
              <strong>carbon fibre</strong> and similar ultra-lightweight
              materials with honeycomb structure. The minimum weight permissible
              is 740 kg (1,631 lb) including the driver but not fuel. Cars are
              weighed with dry-weather tyres fitted. Prior to the 2014 F1
              season, cars often weighed in under this limit so teams added
              ballast in order to add weight to the car. The advantage of using
              ballast is that it can be placed anywhere in the car to provide
              ideal weight distribution. This can help lower the car's centre of
              gravity to improve stability and also allows the team to fine-tune
              the weight distribution of the car to suit individual circuits.

            <h2>Engines</h2>
            <p>
              The FIA announced to change the 2.4-litre V8 to 1.6-litre V6
              hybrid engines for the 2014 season. The new regulations allow
              kinetic and heat energy recovery systems. Forced induction is now
              allowed, and instead of limiting the boost level, fuel flow
              restriction at 100 kg of gasoline per hour maximum is introduced.
              The engines sounded very different due to the lower rev limit
              (15000 rpm) and the turbocharger. While superchargers are allowed,
              all constructors opted to use a turbo.
            </p>
            <p>
              The new formula allows turbocharged engines, which last appeared
              in 1988. These have their efficiency improved through
              turbo-compounding by recovering energy from exhaust gases. The
              original proposal for four-cylinder turbocharged engines was not
              welcomed by the racing teams, in particular Ferrari. Adrian Newey
              stated during the 2011 European Grand Prix that the change to a V6
              enables teams to carry the engine as a stressed member, whereas an
              inline-4 would have required a space frame. A compromise was
              reached, allowing V6 forced induction engines instead. The engines
              rarely exceed 12,000 rpm during qualifying and race, due to the
              new fuel flow restrictions.

            />
            <p>
              Energy recovery systems such as KERS had a boost of 160 hp (120
              kW) and 2 megajoules per lap. KERS was renamed Motor Generator
              Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K). Heat energy recovery systems were also
              allowed, under the name Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H)
            </p>
            <p>
              The 2015 season was an improvement on 2014, adding about 30-50 hp
              (20-40 kW) to most engines, the Mercedes engine being the most
              powerful with 870 hp (649 kW). In 2019, Renault's engine was
              claimed to have hit 1,000 hp in qualifying trim.

            <h2>Transmission</h2>
            <p>
              Formula One cars use highly automated semi-automatic sequential
              gearboxes with paddle-shifters, with regulations stating that 8
              forward gears (increased from 7 from the 2014 season onwards) and
              1 reverse gear must be used, with rear-wheel-drive. The gearbox is
              constructed of carbon titanium, as heat dissipation is a critical
              issue, and is bolted onto the back of the engine. Fully-automatic
              gearboxes, and systems such as launch control and traction
              control, have been illegal since 2004 and 2008, respectively, to
              keep driver skill and involvement important in controlling the
              car, and to ensure that no teams are using these systems illegally
              to gain a competitive advantage, as well as to keep costs down.
              The driver initiates gear shifts using paddles mounted on the back
              of the steering wheel, and advanced electric solenoids, hydraulic
              actuators, and sensors perform the actual shift, as well as the
              electronic throttle control. Clutch control is also performed
              electro-hydraulically, except when launching from a standstill
              (i.e., stationary, neutral) into first gear, where the driver
              operates the clutch manually using a lever mounted on the back of
              the steering wheel.[22] The last F1 car fitted with a conventional
              manual gearbox, the Forti FG01, raced in 1995.
            </p>

              alt="3D model of the inside of a Formula 1 car transmission"
            />
            <p>
              A modern F1 clutch is a multi-plate carbon design with a diameter
              of less than 100 mm (3.9 in), weighing less than 1 kg (2.2 lb) and
              handling around 540 kW (720 hp). As of the 2009 race season, all
              teams are using seamless-shift transmissions, which allow almost
              instantaneous changing of gears with minimum loss of drive. Shift
              times for modern Formula One cars are in the region of 2 - 3 ms.
              In order to keep costs low in Formula One, gearboxes must last
              five consecutive events and since 2015, gearbox ratios will be
              fixed for each season (for 2014 they could be changed only once).
              Changing a gearbox before the allowed time will cause a penalty of
              five places drop on the starting grid for the first event that the
              new gearbox is used.

            <h2>Aerodynamics</h2>
            <p>
              Aerodynamics has become key to success in the sport and teams
              spend tens of millions of dollars on research and development in
              the field each year.
            </p>
            <p>
              The aerodynamic designer has two primary concerns: the creation of
              downforce, to help push the car's tyres onto the track and improve
              cornering forces; and minimising the drag that gets caused by
              turbulence and acts to slow the car down.
            </p>

              alt="Flow of the air over a Formula 1 car simulated in CFD"
            />
            <p>
              Several teams started to experiment with the now familiar wings in
              the late 1960s. Racecar wings operate on the same principle as
              aircraft wings but are configured to cause a downward force rather
              than an upward one. A modern Formula One car is capable of
              developing 6 Gs of lateral cornering force due to aerodynamic
              downforce. The aerodynamic downforce allowing this is typically
              greater than the weight of the car. That means that,
              theoretically, at high speeds, they could drive on the upside-down
              surface of a suitable structure; e.g. on the ceiling.
            </p>
            <p>
              The use of aerodynamics to increase the cars' grip was pioneered
              in Formula One in the 1968 season by Lotus, Ferrari and Brabham.
              At first, Lotus introduced modest front wings and a spoiler on
              Graham Hill's Lotus 49B at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix, then
              Brabham and Ferrari went one better at the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix
              with full-width wings mounted on struts high above the driver.
